# Vinces Rice Production Prediction

This machine learning project predicts the annual production of rice in Vinces, Ecuador using historical agricultural datasets from 2018 to 2022.

## Goal
Compare multiple regression and classification models to find the most accurate predictor of rice production, and deploy it through a simple web interface using Flask.

## Models Evaluated
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- KMeans Clustering (for analysis)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM Classifier)

## Dataset
Real-world datasets from 2018â€“2022 (`vinces2018.csv`, etc.) located in the `data/` folder.

## Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Keras / TensorFlow
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (Materialize)
